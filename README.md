# RandomChance
Exploring random chance in algorithms and life through d3-based automatic drawings

## Artist Statement
Life can seem random, but more often this is only due to lack of a large enough perspective. In tech, computer scientists often need to use random numbers but computers are perhaps the antithesis of random. So how can we get a machine to reliably create randomness? The answer depends but randomizing algorithms are often based on the time of day or another temporal based factor.  This series engages with randomness through automatic drawings created using a random algorithm for different variables including color, length, angle, and curve. I see each of these random factors as being correlated to factors in our own lives. The color could represent the randomness of our place of birth, or our families. The random angles can represent our decisions over a lifetime. The different types of angles, sometimes curvy, sometimes sharp, can represent our personalities. As we watch the lines being drawn, we are asked to consider our own paths, and what has brought us to this present moment.
